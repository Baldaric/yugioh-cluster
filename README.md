# Yu-Gi-Oh! Card Classification Project

## Overview

This project aims to classify Yu-Gi-Oh! cards based on their effects, attributes, and characteristics to help both new and experienced players better understand card roles and strategies within the game. The goal is to create a clustering and classification system that categorizes cards into intuitive groups.
